# Make Along With Phil EP1 - Weather Forecaster

Join me in this exciting 'Make Along With Me' series as we dive into the world of DIY electronics and 3D printing! In our first episode, we're building a DIY Weather Forecaster using an ESP32 board, a BMP280 sensor, a CNC 3018, and a 3D printed case.

In this step-by-step guide,we cover everything from PCB design and 3D printing to programming the ESP32 with our provided source code. Perfect for hobbyists, makers, and tech enthusiasts alike, this project promises a hands-on, engaging experience.

No stone is left unturned as we walk you through assembly, testing, and even how to interpret the data from your very own Weather Forecaster. Don't miss out - subscribe and hit the bell to be notified of future episodes in this series!

Remember, making is more than just following instructions - it's about learning, experimenting, and having fun. Let's get started!
